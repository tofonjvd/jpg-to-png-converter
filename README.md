this project is focusing on converting jpg files to png. It's just a test for working with GIT and Image Processing. But if you're interested, you are open to collaborate !
This code will get two arguments from command line which the first one is the folder of your jpg files and the second one is the output folder.
an example of the correct syntax is:
python main.py IMAGE_PATH OUTPUT_PATH
